ðŸ¤“ I enjoy mastering difficult concepts and helping other people understand them.

During my long career, Iâ€™ve worked as a web developer, IT manager, technical writer, publisher, and university lecturer. Yes, itâ€™s quite a range, but all these roles bring together my love of learning, teaching, and technology.

## Coaching and Training

I offer academic coaching and training independently, and also as an associate for [Research Coach](https://www.researchcoach.co.uk). You can find out more about my [workshop offerings](../workshops/).

My main areas are:

- Building sustainable writing practices.
- Using generative AI in research and writing.
- Project managing research.
- Creating effective workflows with digital tools.
- Making academic and technical concepts understandable for wider audiences.

I'm also available to design and deliver bespoke training for academic or tech clients, either on Zoom or through video-based online courses. Currently, I'm unable to offer in-person training.

## Content Creation

You can also hire me for technical writing (user docs) or content creation projects (e.g. instructional videos). My tech experience includes:

- DevOps
- Web development
- Software engineering

All work is fully remote. I'm not currently seeking a full-time or permanent role.
