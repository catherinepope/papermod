Hello 👋 My name is Catherine and I'm facilitating a series of three online workshops for the CHASE Neurodiversity Network. 

In each session, we'll: 
 
- Discuss the challenges of academic writing.  
- Identify the limitations of traditional advice for the neurodivergent community.  
- Explore some different approaches to experiment with in subsequent sessions.

Although the sessions provide an opportunity to interact with other researchers, you are welcome to participate in any way that feels comfortable for you. You can speak, type in the chatbox, or remain in the background with your camera off. There is no pressure. And you don't need to disclose your neurotype, unless you want to.

On this page, I'll share details of each session, along with more information on the ideas we'll be discussing. 

For Zoom links, please [contact the administrator](mailto:chaseneurodiversity@gmail.com).

## Session 1 - Externalising and Organising Your Research Brain

**Wednesday 4th March, 11am-1pm**

📝 For this session, it's helpful if you have paper, pens, and sticky notes available.

### Facilitator Content

- Why externalisation matters for neurodivergent thinkers (reducing cognitive load, making the invisible visible, getting a sense of progress).  
- Demonstration of visual organisation methods (mind map, concept map, timeline/flowchart). 
- The bridge between visual organisation and written structure.  
  
### Group Discussion

How different neurodivergent traits affect information processing.  
  
### Exercises

- Getting ideas out of your head.
- Mapping your ideas.
- Translating maps into a writing structure.
