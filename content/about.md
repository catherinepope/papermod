Hello 👋 I’m Catherine Pope, a trainer, academic coach, and technical content creator. 

🎓 I have a PhD in [Victorian literature](/tags/victorian/), which I was awarded for my thesis on Florence Marryat, a prolific novelist who enjoyed a very colourful personal life. Her most famous novel is about a bisexual psychic vampire called Harriet. As you might have guessed, Marryat wasn’t a conventional Victorian.

✍️ I've [written three books](/writing/), along with some book chapters and introductions.

A couple of years ago, I left the tech sector to coach and train academics, from PhD researchers through to professors. You can find out more about [my work](/work/).

🧠 In 2023, just before my 50th birthday, I was diagnosed as autistic. Although this wasn’t a complete surprise, it took me a while to absorb the implications. Although I haven't received a formal diagnosis, it's likely I also have ADHD - which makes me AuDHD. The ADHD part of my brain loves learning new things; the autistic part enjoys developing systems for organising them. It's mostly a harmonious relationship.

🎹 Like many autistic people, I develop intense interests and am able to hyperfocus on them. My current obsession is learning to play the piano. Because I often find it impossible to choose between things I love, I’m also learning classical guitar. Oh, and German, too.

I live in Brighton on the south coast of England with my partner [Tanya](https://www.tanyaizzard.co.uk) and [thousands of books](https://www.librarything.com/profile/catherinepope).
