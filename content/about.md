Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Catherine Pope, a writer, academic coach, and trainer. 

I have a PhD in Victorian literature, which I was awarded for my thesis on Florence Marryat, a prolific novelist who enjoyed a very colourful personal life. Her most famous novel is about a bisexual psychic vampire called Harriet. As you might have guessed, Marryat wasnâ€™t a conventional Victorian.

A couple of years ago, I left the tech sector to coach and train academics, from PhD researchers through to professors. You can find out more about [my work](/work/).

In 2023, just before my 50th birthday, I was diagnosed as autistic. Although this wasnâ€™t a complete surprise, it took me a while to absorb the implications. Iâ€™ll occasionally share my experiences through the blog, which hopefully some people will find helpful. There are a couple of caveats: firstly, Iâ€™m not a medical doctor, so none of this constitutes advice. Secondly, everyoneâ€™s experience of autism is unique and valid.

Like many autistic people, I develop special interests and am able to hyperfocus on them. My current obsession is learning to play the piano. Because I often find it impossible to choose between things I love, Iâ€™m also learning classical guitar. Oh, and German, too.

I live in Brighton on the south coast of England with my partner Tanya and thousands of books.
