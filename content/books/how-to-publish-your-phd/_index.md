You’ve passed your viva, you’ve changed your title to Dr on your bank cards. Now you want to turn your thesis into a monograph. You’re keen to get started, but how exactly do you go about it? Do you just need to make a few tweaks here and there? Or are you going to have to rewrite every single word? What on earth is a monograph, anyway? And, most importantly, how long will it take you?

There’s a lot to understand before you embark upon your writing adventure. This practical book guides you through everything you need to know about academic publishing in the 21st century. You’ll establish your purpose and scope, plan your schedule, approach a publisher, and actually write your book. Catherine Pope draws on her own experience of writing and publishing to support you through each stage of the process.
