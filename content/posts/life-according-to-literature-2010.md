Using only books you have read this year (2010), cleverly answer these questions. Try not to repeat a book title. It’s a lot harder than you think!

**How do you feel:** A Blameless Woman (John Strange Winter)

**Describe where you currently live:** City and Suburb (Charlotte Riddell)

**If you could go anywhere, where would you go:** [East of Suez](../east-of-suez/) (Alice Perrin)

**Your favourite form of transportation:** Comin’ Thro’ the Rye (Helen Mathers)

**Your best friend is:** Wee Wifie (Rosa Nouchette Carey)

**You and your friends are:** Bluestockings (Jane Robinson)

**What’s the weather like:** Footprints in the Snow (Dora Russell)

**Favourite time of day:** Transition (Emma Brooke)

**If your life was a:** Lucky Disappointment (Florence Marryat)

**What is life to you:** Realities (Eliza Lynn Linton)
