**UPDATE:** Revisiting this post 14 years later, I realise I didn't write up four of the novels. This is probably for the good reason that I needed to get on with my thesis (which wasn't about Trollope) üßê I'll pursue a much more modest challenge in 2025, re-reading and reflecting on _Linda Tressel_, _Kept in the Dark_, _Orley Farm_, and _The Three Clerks_.
