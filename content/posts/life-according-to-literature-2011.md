It’s that time of year again when I suddenly wish I’d read books with titles containing verbs. There are still a few weeks left in 2011, but I shall be devoting those to my much-neglected thesis. Anyway, here’s the idea:

**Using only books you have read this year (2011), answer these questions. Try not to repeat a book title.**

**Describe yourself:** The Uncommon Reader (Alan Bennett)

**How do you feel:** At Home (Bill Bryson)

**Describe where you currently live:** The White House by the Sea (Matilda Betham-Edwards)

**If you could go anywhere, where would you go:** [Barchester Towers](../barchester-towers/) (Anthony Trollope)

**Your favourite form of transportation:** [Black Beauty](../black-beauty/) (Anna Sewell)

**Your best friend is:** The Perfect Man (David Waller)

**You and your friends are:** The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists (Robert Tressell)

**What’s the weather like:** Monochromes (Ella D’Arcy)

**You fear:** A World on Fire (Amanda Foreman)

**What is the best advice you have to give:** Bury the Chains (Adam Hochschild)

**Thought for the day:** Howards End is on the Landing (Susan Hill)

**How I would like to die:** Chocolate Wars (Deborah Cadbury)

**My soul’s present condition:** [A Thing in Disguise](../a-thing-in-disguise/) (Kate Colquhoun)
