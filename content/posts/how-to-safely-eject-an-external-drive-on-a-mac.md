When I replaced my MacBook recently, it suddenly started shrieking "Disk Not Ejected Properly" every time I wakened it from its slumbers. As the disk is my external backup drive, I felt nervous.

My previous MacBook (an M3) handled the ejection without any problems; my replacement M2 has other ideas.[^1]

Sometimes the error is triggered by the length of time it takes the drive to respond, rather than failing to eject safely. Either way, the risks are the same.

## Why is it important to eject external devices safely?

Ejecting safely is important because it:

- **Prevents data loss** - your Mac might be holding data in a temporary memory buffer (or write cache) to improve performance. Ejecting the drive tells your computer to hurry up and finish transferring this data to permanent storage.
- **Avoids data corruption** - if you disconnect a drive while it's writing data, the file - or even the entire file system - can become corrupted. Then your drive is unreadable ðŸ™€ This is especially unfortunate if you're using it as a backup.
- **Protects the device's firmware** - in _rare_ cases, an unexpected disconnect corrupts the internal firmware that manages the drive. Then the drive is effectively useless.

## What can you do to eject a drive safely?

### Buy a newer device

Inevitably, many of the search results told me to bin my perfectly good external drive and buy a new one. While newer devices might handle ejection better, there's no guarantee.

Some drives include their own power management, which can interfere with the macOS sleep/wake cycles - so a new drive might not solve the problem. I'm a nerd, but even I can't face researching _those_ issues.

### Remember to eject the drive manually

Theoretically, you could right-click the drive on your desktop and select "Eject", but who's going to do that consistently? Not me, certainly.

### Install an app that manages ejection for you

The most elegant solution I found was an [app called Jettison](https://www.stclairsoft.com/Jettison/). For around $10, Jettison safely ejects any external drives when your Mac goes to sleep or you close the lid. You can decide which drives it controls, and there's also a manual override with configurable hotkeys.

The app was easy to install (I can't remember doing it, which is always a good sign) and it's a one-off cost. No recurring payments for the rest of time.

## Conclusion

I've been using Jettison for a couple of months now. It runs in the background, quietly and unobtrusively. My drive is safely ejected each time and I never have to think about it. Bliss. 

[^1]: I returned the M3 when I left my job. For financial and environmental reasons, I bought a refurbished M2 from the excellent [MacFinder](https://www.macfinder.co.uk).
