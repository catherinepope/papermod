If there’s one topic guaranteed to suck all the fun out of a writing workshop, it’s signposting. Signposts include descriptive headings, cross-references, and emphasis of argument. For the writer, these mechanisms feel clunky and dull; for the reader, though, these navigational aids make the text much more digestible — especially when it’s a long document like a thesis or a monograph.

Your reader or examiner is probably reading your work alongside a whole heap of other research material. They’ll be dipping in and out over weeks — maybe even months — so need frequent reminders of what you’ve already told them and a roadmap of what’s coming next. With a clear structure and frequent signposts, they’re much less likely to miss something important.

## Examples of signposts

### Chapter or section outlines

At the beginning of every chapter or section, you should explain how it’s structured. This isn’t spoiling the fun, it’s helping your reader get a sense of the work. They can then focus on the arguments. “In this section, I explore X, arguing Y.”

### Mini-conclusions

Although you’ve already explained your claim in some detail, concluding with a succinct summary helps the reader follow your overall argument. You can think of this as a sub-total that builds up to the grand total in the main conclusion. Your reader shouldn’t be struggling to fathom your argument or its significance.

Some academic writers insist it shouldn’t be necessary to repeat your argument: if it was strong enough in the first place, your reader will have understood it. Realistically, though, most of us have the attention span of a gnat. Mini-conclusions also make us feel confident that we have indeed grasped the argument.

### Emphasis of argument

Sometimes, you need to remind your reader of related arguments. For example, “As I argued in Chapter Two, this text ….”. This way, you’re creating connections and allowing them to form a conceptual map in their mind.

### Cross-references

If you’ve explained a theory or concept earlier on, for example, in your introduction, you don’t want to repeat it in a later chapter. However, you still need your reader to know that you’ve talked about it. In this case, you can say something like, “Here I apply the theory of X, which I discuss more fully on p3,” or, “In this section, I draw on the theory of X, which I explain in my introduction.” You don’t want your reader thinking, “Why hasn’t this author explained her use of this theory?” You have! It’s just elsewhere.

Cross-references are especially important now that many readers use electronic devices. On a Kindle or phone, it’s much harder to flick through to find a specific section. These formats rely on a robust structure, signposts, and hyperlinks.

### Headings and sub-headings

Descriptive headings break up the text, giving the reader natural pauses. They also provide accurate signposts to specific pieces of information. If your headings just say 1.1, 1.2, it’s easy for readers to get lost. Numbering might be the convention for your discipline or publisher, though, so check what’s required.

A sub-heading is also a useful expedient for masking a gear change. Perhaps there’s a big leap between paragraphs and you’re not sure how to add a segue. If so, adding a sub-heading signals the change of topic to the reader. This device should be used sparingly. A chapter can’t be a loose collection of ideas.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Next time you’re reading an academic book or paper, see if you can identify the signposts. You might also notice what a difference these mechanisms make to you as a reader. I don’t know about you, but I get quite grumpy when an article is hard to follow. You don’t want your reader to be grumpy, especially if they’re an examiner or a peer reviewer.

[Pat Thomson](https://patthomson.net/2011/09/18/signposting-your-journal-articles-and-chapters/) points out that signposting also helps you as the writer: “In setting out the way in which the article will proceed and why it is as it is, you provide yourself with a way of keeping check on where you are going, why and how.” If you’re writing your thesis, your future self will thank you when you start your viva preparation.

If you’re currently working on a chapter, check the following:

- Have you provided an outline in your introduction to explain what the chapter covers and how it’s arranged?
- If it’s a long chapter, have you divided it into sections with descriptive headings?
- Have you cross-referenced any material elsewhere that the reader needs to know about, such as explanations of terms, or how you’re using a theory?

If we all commit to better signposting, we can make academic a more enjoyable and rewarding experience.
