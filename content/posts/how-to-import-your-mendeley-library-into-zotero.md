In my previous post, I showed you how to import your EndNote library into Zotero. On Twitter, @danalamm asked me whether it was also possible to import from Mendeley. Well, I’m pleased to report that it’s even easier. Here’s how to do it.

1) Select your items to export from Mendeley
In the middle column of Mendeley, select the items for export. If you want everything, it’s quickest to click All Documents on the left, click the first item in the list, then press Ctrl+A (Cmd+A on a Mac).

2) Export your library as a file
Now click File > Export (or press Ctrl+E) and save the file somewhere you can easily find it.

Export from Mendeley

You might want to change the file name to My Mendeley Collection so that you know what it is.  Make sure the RIS format is selected, click Save, then close Mendeley.

3) Import into Zotero
Open Zotero and click File > Import. Locate the file you just exported from Mendeley. Zotero imports your items and places them in a new collection with the same name as your saved file.

Importing items into Zotero

You can delete this collection by right-clicking and choosing Delete Collection – this doesn’t affect the items within it.

Unfortunately, Zotero won’t retain your Mendeley folders or groups, but it does import the PDFs of any attached journal articles.
