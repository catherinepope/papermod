SET THE SCENE

"Bad fiction provides nuggets of social history unobtainable elsewhere," writes Victorian Glendinning in her magisterial biography _Trollope_.[^1] That's not to say that _The Three Clerks_ is a _bad_ novel, but I think its value lies more in what it tells us about the 1850s, than its ability to keep us away from Netflix. Although Glendinning was referring to another Trollope novel, _The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson_, those title characters make a couple of oblique appearances here, too. Indeed, _The Three Clerks_ is an odd patchwork of autobiography, other Trollope novels, and Dickensian pastiche.

PLOT

The plot centers around the government Department of Internal Navigation, described as "exactly antipodistic of the Circumlocution Office". The eponymous clerks - Henry Norman, Alaric Tudor, and Charley Tudor - are all employed by this department. They are also frequent visitors to the suburban home of Mrs Woodward and her three daughters. The young men compete for social advancement in both the civil service and for the hands of the Miss Woodwards. Alaric Tudor, who is just skin stretched over ambition, quickly falls into the eager hands of dodgy stockbroker Undy Scott. Soon his limited funds are tied up in dubious schemes, landing him in jail.

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS


CHARACTERS

"It is not by our virtues or our vices that we are judged, even by those who know us best; but by such credit for virtues or for vices as we may have acquired. Now young Tudor's credit for virtue was very slight, and he did not know how to extend it."


Well-drawn characters

"the old widow knew the value of her money too well to risk it in the keeping of the best he that ever wore boots."

"She was a quick little body, full of good-humour, slightly given to repartee, and perhaps rather too impatient of a fool. But though averse to a fool, she could sympathize with folly."

"'I mean to say, Harry, that my mother is the best and only judge of what should, and what should not, take place there.' Norman felt himself somewhat silenced by this, and walked on for a time without speaking. He was a little too apt to take upon himself the character of Mentor;"


The character names became increasingly irritating and downright ridiculous: Mr Everscreech the vicar, Mr Minusex the mathematician, Mr Whip Vigil the official, and Alphabet Precis the clerk. There are many more where those came from. Charles Dickens was, of course, partial to exaggerated names. However, the fairytale quality to his fiction makes them less jarring. I lost the will to read after encountering Mr Embryo the office junior. Presumably Trollope was pleased with the name Fidus Neverbend (of the Woods and Forests department, since you ask). John Neverbend is the self-important president in Trollope's futuristic story _The Fixed Period_. We are not told whether they are related. Trollope also makes good use of Mr Chaffanbrass, an Old Bailey barrister who appears in _Orley Farm_, and _Phineas Finn_. And the discussion of decimal coinage - one of the Palliser novels.

Novel-within-a-novel - Charley Tudor writes 'Crinoline and Macassar' 

"If you begin with a long history of who's who and all that, why he won't read three pages; but if you touch him up with a startling incident or two at the first go off, then give him a chapter of horrors, then another of fun, then a little love or a little slang, or something of that sort, why, you know, about the end of the first volume, you may describe as much as you like, and tell everything about everybody's father and mother for just as many pages as you want to fill. At least that's what the editor says."

"I'm only to be allowed ten paragraphs for each number, and I am expected to have an incident for every other paragraph for the first four days."

"So ends the second chapter--bravo, Charley," said Mrs. Woodward. "In the name of the British female public, I beg to thank you for your exertions."



Autobiographical elements

"It was too notorious that the Civil Service was filled by the family fools of the aristocracy and middle classes, and that any family who had no fool to send, sent in lieu thereof some invalid past hope."

Trollope was describing his own struggles with examinations. Competitive examinations were introduced in 1855. Trollope remained opposed to the system, which he circumvented through patronage in 1834. He believed that exams couldn't possibly give an indication of a man's character. Honesty was more important than the ability to cram.

Competing with Dickens




"Alas! how many of us from week to week call ourselves worms and dust and miserable sinners, describe ourselves as chaff for the winds, grass for the burning, stubble for the plough, as dirt and filth fit only to be trodden under foot, and yet in all our doings before the world cannot bring home to ourselves the conviction that we require other guidance than our own!"

"It was the nature of Tudor's disposition, that he never for a moment rested satisfied with the round of the ladder on which he had contrived to place himself. He had no sooner gained a step than he looked upwards to see how the next step was to be achieved." (the hedonic stepladder)

"It has now become the doctrine of a large class of politicians that political honesty is unnecessary, slow, subversive of a man's interests, and incompatible with quick onward movement."
