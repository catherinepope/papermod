One of the questions I’m asked most frequently is whether it’s possible for EndNote users to switch easily to Zotero. Yes, it is! Many of the tutorials focus on exporting your library in RIS format. Although this is relatively straightforward, this method doesn't retain your PDF attachments, groups, or formatting. In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the XML method. You need to follow the instructions precisely, but you'll get a much better result.


## 1. Export a RIS file from EndNote

A RIS file is a format that allows citation tools to exchange data.

In EndNote, make sure you have **All References** selected on the left, then click **File > Export** and save the file somewhere you can easily find it. The file type should 


 The name defaults to `library`, but you might want to call it something more distinctive like `Mendeley`.

Open Zotero and click **File > Import**. Locate the file you just exported from Mendeley. You then have a couple of options:

- Check the box if you want to place your imported items in a new collection with the same name as your saved file. If you leave the box unchecked, they'll just be added to **My Library**.

- Choose whether you want to copy any attachments to your Zotero storage folder - they then contribute towards your [storage limit](../managing-storage-in-zotero/) of 300Mb. If you choose **Link to files in original location**, they won't be synced by Zotero.

You should now see that Zotero has created a new collection called My EndNote Library, which now contains all your imported items.

There are two problems with this method:

- It doesn't export PDFs attachments.
- You won't retain any of your EndNote groups or the formatting in your records.

Method 2 is fiddlier, but more powerful.

Creating this tutorial has reminded me how much I dislike EndNote. If you're moving to Zotero, I feel sure you're going to be much happier.
