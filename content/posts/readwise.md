If you're anything like me, you consume all sorts of content: books, blog posts, newsletters, and podcasts. It's hard keeping track of it all. In this short demo, I'll show you [Readwise](https://readwise.io), a web-based tool for collecting, organising, and reviewing your highlights.

I'm not associated in any way with Readwise, I just love it!
