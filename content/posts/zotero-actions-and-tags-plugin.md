The Actions and Tags (AT) plugin allows you to automate tags and other actions. For instance, for new items you could automatically:

- Add a "to read" tag (which is then removed when you read the item).
- Create a new note with a outline or template for your notes.
- Translate the title/abstract into another language.

For more information, see the developer's website (https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-actions-tags).

Zotero plugins are in `.xpi` format. To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your computer. Then, in Zotero:

- Click Tools > Plugins
- Click gear icon
- Choose **Install Plugin from File**
- Locate your downloaded .xpi file and click **Open**.
- Restart Zotero

You'll see your plugin is added to the list and enabled.


Need the Better Notes plugin

Thank the developers.
