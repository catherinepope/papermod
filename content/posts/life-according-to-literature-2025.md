I recently rummaged through some old blog posts and found this literary meme. After a gap of over a decade, I'm giving it another go. Literature was my refuge in 2025, so I'm hoping this will be easy ...

**THE RULES:** Using only books you have read this year, answer these questions. Try not to repeat a book title.

**Describe yourself:** *Determined* by Robert Sapolsky

**How do you feel:**  *Lost in Thought* by Zena Hitz

**Describe where you currently live:** *The Age of Uncertainty* by David Spiegelhalter

**If you could go anywhere, where would you go:** *The Best of All Possible Worlds* by Michael Kempe

**Your favourite form of transportation:** *Wandering Through Life* by Donna Leon

**Your best friend is:** *Good Prose* by Tracy Kidder & Richard Todd

**You and your friends are:**  *Free Agents* by Kevin Mitchell

**What’s the weather like:** *A Dry Spell* by Clare Chambers

**You fear:**  *Monoculture* by F S Michaels

**What is the best advice you have to give:** *No Straight Road Takes You There* by Rebecca Solnit

**Thought for the day:**  *We Are Free to Change the World* by Lyndsey Stonebridge

**How I would like to die:**  *The Sense of an Ending* by Julian Barnes

**My soul’s present condition:**  *Transient and Strange* by Nell Greenfieldboyce

Well, that wasn't too difficult. The answers are mostly philosophical, which very much reflects what I read over the year. I finished [170 books](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/catherinepope?tag=2025&collection=-1), which is a lot, even for me. I stopped reading the news, ignored social media, and watched very little telly.

Wishing you a happy, healthy, and book-filled 2026 📚
