The festive season is upon us once more, so it is time for the annual Life According to Literature blog meme. I’ve been rather slack with my reading this year – only 86 rather than the usual 100+ books – but there’s still a week to go. [Last year](../life-according-to-literature-2013/) was much easier, as I was doing a lot of frantic PhD-related reading.

Wishing you a merry and book-filled Yuletide.

**THE RULES:** Using only books you have read this year ([2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730221526/http://blog.catherinepope.co.uk/books-2014/ "Books 2014")), answer these questions. Try not to repeat a book title.
