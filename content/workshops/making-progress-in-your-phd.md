## Feedback

- “Yes, it did meet my expectations, it also superseded them. The tips on how to complete, timetables, as well as ways to manage the supervisory process, have been incredibly helpful.”
- “This was a fantastic training that combined practical advice, skill building, and carved out time to implement these tactics with a one-day writing session. I would 100% recommend others to attend this event. Catherine Pope has, once more, been crucial to the survival of my mental health and saviour of my thesis.”
- “One month on, I wanted to let you know how much it has helped me. Breaking down big, daunting tasks into smaller, more approachable ones has made me feel more capable of getting where I want to go. Thank you!”
