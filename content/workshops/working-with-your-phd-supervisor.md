The supervisor-student relationship is one of the most important factors in PhD success, yet many researchers struggle to make it work effectively. This interactive workshop helps you build a productive professional relationship with your supervisors.

You'll explore how to establish clear expectations, communicate your needs effectively, and adapt your working relationship as you develop greater autonomy throughout your PhD journey. Through practical frameworks and group discussions, you'll learn to navigate the transition from dependent student to independent researcher.

We'll cover:

- Understanding different supervisory styles and adapting your approach accordingly.
- Building autonomy while benefiting from your supervisor's expert guidance.
- Improving communication through effective agenda-setting and email strategies.
- Requesting and receiving constructive feedback on your work.
- Addressing problems before they escalate.

By the end of the session, you'll have:

- Clarified expectations and boundaries for your supervisory relationship.
- Developed strategies for taking initiative in meetings and communications.
- Learned techniques for requesting specific, actionable feedback.
- Created an action plan for building a stronger working relationship with your supervisor.
- Identified additional sources of support beyond your primary supervisor.
