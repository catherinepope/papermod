Are you horrified by the thought of confronting your own work? Have you left it to the last minute, secretly hoping it’s better than you think? Although editing feels overwhelming, it’s much easier when you adopt a systematic approach and develop a structured plan.

Through activities and tutorials, this interactive workshop provides you with a clear strategy for turning that messy draft into a structured piece of writing. 

With the help of an experienced facilitator, you’ll break the process down into more manageable chunks. You’ll also get the opportunity to apply the techniques to a piece of writing.

Here’s what we’ll cover: 

- Working out how much time you need for editing.
- Improving structure.
- Signposting your argument.
- Maintaining consistency, clarity, and connections.
- Strengthening your academic voice and contribution.
- Proofreading your own work. 

This session can be adapted to focus specifically on editing a doctoral thesis.

👩🏽‍🎓 **Audience:** Researchers at all stages and in any discipline.

⏰ **Duration:** 3 hours

## Feedback

- “Not only have are the tools invaluable in themselves, I have a much clearer view of how long it will take to complete my thesis and can have a much more constructive and realistic conversation with my supervisors.”
- “Editing is definitely one of my biggest hurdles with academic writing, but the workshop has made it feel so much more doable and straightforward to structure. The end of the DPhil and tackling that big editing load doesn’t feel nearly as overwhelming now! So thank you so much for all your help and guidance today.”
- “Catherine delivered a great workshop – with advice and lessons seldom offered by other PhD training.”
