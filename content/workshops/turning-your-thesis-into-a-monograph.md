You’ve passed your viva and got your life back. Now everyone keeps asking, “When are you going to publish your PhD?”

You’re vaguely aware of what’s involved in writing a monograph, but you’re not sure where to start. There are so many options, decisions, and conflicting experiences. What’s right for you? And, more importantly, how long will it take? 

This interactive workshop demystifies the process so you know exactly what’s involved at every stage.

With the help of an experienced facilitator, you’ll develop a publishing strategy that’s right for you. 

You’ll learn about: 

- Identifying and approaching publishers.
- Writing an effective book proposal.

- Deciding on the right structure.
- Developing a productive writing process.

By the end of the session, you’ll be ready to get going.
