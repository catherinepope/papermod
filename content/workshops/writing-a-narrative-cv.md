Narrative CVs are gaining popularity as a way for researchers to showcase a wider range of skills and experience in grant applications. This interactive workshop focuses on the practical skills of crafting compelling narrative CVs. 

Through targeted activities and examples relevant to your specific project or practice, you'll develop strategies for presenting your research story effectively.

By the end of the session, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Identify and articulate your "invisible skills" and experience relevant to your specific project or practice
area.
- Provide compelling evidence of your experience and expertise.
- Translate your experience into narrative CV structure and format.
- Describe your research and practice using clear, impactful language.
- Create both individual and team/group narrative CVs.
- Develop strategies for presenting practice-based work (exhibitions, artworks, curatorial activities) as
legitimate research within academic frameworks.
- Begin crafting your own narrative CV with confidence.

The session combines discussion, hands-on activities, and peer feedback opportunities. With an experienced
facilitator, you'll work on real examples from your own project or practice area, making the learning
immediately applicable. You'll leave with a clear action plan and draft content for your own narrative CV,
whether for funding applications or academic career development.

**Prerequisites:** To ensure participants are able to gain maximum benefit from the workshop, there will be an
element of pre-session reading covering the [background, fundamental principles and structure of narrative CVs](../resources/an-introduction-to-narrative-cvs/).

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì **Audience:** This workshop is designed for researchers who have a specific project idea they are planning to
submit for external research funding within the next 12-18 months, or those seeking to present practice-based work (exhibitions, artworks, curatorial practice) as research in an academic CV format.

‚è∞ **Duration:** 3 hours

## Feedback

- "Thank you so much for providing training at this very helpful seminar.  I now have an excellent strategy for structuring writing around storytelling, which will be useful for how I describe my research narrative, as well as for other tasks such as writing journal articles and proposals. I feel more confident about writing a narrative CV as a consequence of this training."
- "I knew very little about narrative CVs prior to this session.  This session has helped me see the value of these, what to include and how to best produce one which will be useful for enhancing my personal profile and for funding bids etc. I really liked that it was across different departments and that the session had time to also make new contacts and get different perspectives into a developing narrative CV."
- "I‚Äôd read around narrative CVs but it was really useful to see examples and understand how to write one in more detail in a supportive environment."
