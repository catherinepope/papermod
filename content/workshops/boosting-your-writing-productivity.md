Academic writing is hard at the best of times. It's especially challenging when there‚Äôs so much going on. With many competing priorities, we struggle to consistently make time for writing.

In this interactive session, you‚Äôll discover tools, strategies, and techniques for making writing more manageable (and even enjoyable).

Whether you're tackling a journal article, a book, or a thesis, you'll get insights and practical tips on getting started and maintaining your momentum. 

Here's what we'll cover: 

- Understanding what aspects of your writing you can influence, versus what's beyond your control. 
- Planning a piece of writing using different techniques.
- Establishing effective boundaries that give you the time and headspace to write.
- Improving productivity without compromising your health.
- Staying focused and minimising disruptions.
- Looking after yourself. You're not a machine!

With the help of an experienced facilitator and the rest of the group, you'll start creating a strategy that's right for you.

By the end of the session, you should be able to:

- Distinguish between controllable and uncontrollable factors in your writing process and focus your energy on areas you can influence.
- Select and apply appropriate planning techniques for different types of academic writing project.
- Establish effective boundaries and routines that protect writing time while managing competing academic demands.
