There’s so much to fit into your final year, and it’s hard to plan without a clear direction. This interactive workshop provides a clear roadmap and guidance so you can create an action plan. With the help of an experienced facilitator, you’ll understand the challenges ahead and how you can confront them. We’ll cover topics including:

- Finishing your thesis
- Choosing examiners
- Getting your thesis ready for submission
- Preparing for your viva
- What happens after your viva?

Please note, there are separate sessions that go into much more detail on [preparing for the viva](/workshops/preparing-for-your-viva/) and [editing your thesis](/workshops/editing-your-own-academic-writing/).

By the end of the session, you’ll have: 

- A strategy for the successful completion of your thesis with clear milestones.
- More confidence in your ability to get through the final year.
- A clear sense of the skills you need to develop.
