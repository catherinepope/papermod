Are you starting to wonder, “What else can I do with my PhD?” You’ve invested years in developing specialised expertise, but you’re curious about opportunities outside the traditional academic path.

A PhD equips you with a unique combination of research skills, critical thinking abilities, and subject matter expertise that are highly valued across many industries. However, translating your academic experience into language that resonates with non-academic employers can be challenging.

This interactive workshop opens up new possibilities and helps you see your skills from a different perspective. You’ll discover how to identify transferable skills from your research experience, explore diverse career paths that value PhD-level thinking, and learn practical strategies for networking and job searching outside academia.

We’ll examine real-world examples of successful career transitions, discuss how to craft compelling applications that highlight your unique abilities, and address common concerns about making the leap from academic to industry roles.

By the end of the session, you’ll have:

- Identified your transferable skills and how they apply to non-academic roles
- Explored various career sectors and pathways that value PhD expertise
- Learned strategies for networking and building professional relationships outside academia
- Understood how to tailor your CV and cover letters for industry positions
- Developed techniques for articulating your research experience in accessible language
- Created an action plan for exploring and pursuing alternative career paths

With the help of an experienced facilitator, you’ll gain confidence in exploring new directions for your career.

## Feedback

- “I just wanted to say a really big thank you! It was only really after attending your course that I realised I could apply the same creativity I try to put into my research into making a living as well! I now have a freelance job editing manuscripts … fitting it around my ongoing research activities. So for me it is a real win.”
