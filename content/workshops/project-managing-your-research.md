Are you ready to take control of your research? As an academic, you‚Äôre probably juggling multiple projects, requiring effective planning and execution. As an academic, you probably also lack the time to devise a proper strategy.

In this interactive session, you‚Äôll discover the core elements of project management and how to apply them in your research projects. There‚Äôs no complicated methodology, just practical tips and templates you can apply right away. With the help of an experienced facilitator, you‚Äôll establish an approach that‚Äôs right for you.

Through discussion, activities, and examples, you‚Äôll learn to:

- Define your research goals and objectives.
- Create a realistic project schedule.
- Track your progress with milestones and celebrate success.
- Identify and mitigate risks.
- Communicate effectively with stakeholders.

This workshop equips you with the skills and tools you need to achieve your research goals on time and within budget.

If required, the content can be tailored specifically for PhD researchers. I also offer [a more advanced workshop for those with project management experience](/workshops/advancing-your-project-management-skills/).

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì **Audience:** Researchers at all stages and in any discipline.

‚è∞ **Duration:** 3 hours

## Feedback

- "This was a really useful session for learning clear, practicable ways of organising our PhD projects. Lots of good digital resources, organisational methodologies, crisis-aversion procedures and general wisdom were shared, in a way that made the task of project management feel positive rather than daunting."
- "Provided useful approaches and tools for how to take a step back and manage research when it gets overwhelming, and how to create schedules that include contingency for when things go wrong."
- "Catherine is an amazing trainer ‚Äì really well managed session and lots of tips for success and very supportive atmosphere."
