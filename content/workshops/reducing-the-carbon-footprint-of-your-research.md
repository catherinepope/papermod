What’s your research carbon footprint? While the average person in the UK emits 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, many academics emit more than 15 tonnes. To maintain safe and equitable boundaries, the planet needs us to emit only 2 tonnes per year.

Why do academics emit so much more than the average? In this interactive and non-judgemental workshop, we’ll consider how our energy use, digital activities, travel, diets, consumer habits, and research practices all contribute to our emissions. 

We’ll cover:

- Why we need to urgently reduce our carbon footprint.
- What science tells us about the impact of our activities.
- How we can make changes to reduce carbon emissions.
 
By the end of the workshop, you’ll have:

- Insights into your current carbon footprint.
- Practical actions you can take to reduce your emissions.
- Tools for considering the impact of future activities.
 
It’s never too late to get started! No judgement or pressure, just empowerment.
