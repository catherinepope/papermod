Do you spend hours trying to find the source of that really important paper? Are you despairing at the thought of compiling your bibliography? Perhaps you have a referencing tool, but it’s not working for you. You need Zotero! 

In this interactive demonstration, you’ll learn all about Zotero, a free tool for organising and citing references. With the help of an experienced facilitator, you’ll assess Zotero’s features and find out how it can support your workflow.

You’ll learn how to:

- Add items with the Zotero connector. 
- Organise your library with collections and tags. 
- Search your references. 
- Create citations in Word and Google Docs. 
- Use different citation styles. 

By the end of the session, you’ll be a confident Zotero user, ready to produce perfectly formatted citations and bibliographies.
