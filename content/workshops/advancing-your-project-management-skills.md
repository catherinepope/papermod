As your research career progresses, you‚Äôll increasingly find yourself managing teams, juggling multiple projects, and navigating complex relationships. This workshop is designed for researchers who are already comfortable with the fundamentals of project management and are ready to tackle the challenges of academic leadership roles.

With the help of an experienced facilitator, you‚Äôll explore the transition from individual contributor to research leader, developing your leadership style while building effective research teams. Through case studies and group discussions, you‚Äôll learn to handle stakeholder demands and manage competing priorities that characterise complex academic projects.

You‚Äôll discover communication strategies for managing relationships upward and outward, documentation systems that maintain accountability without administrative overwhelm, and systematic evaluation processes for continuous improvement.

This workshop is particularly valuable for researchers moving into senior roles, leading multi-institutional collaborations, or managing multiple projects. You‚Äôll leave with practical frameworks, communication templates, and strategies for maintaining research excellence while managing increasing complexity.

Please note, I also offer an [introductory workshop](../project-managing-your-research/) for researchers with limited project management experience.
