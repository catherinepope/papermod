Are you still wondering, “What on earth is a literature review?” You know it forms a substantial chunk of your thesis, but you haven’t yet managed to get started.

A well-executed literature review is essential for explaining the context for your thesis, identifying gaps, and establishing your original contribution. However, knowing where to begin and how to plan your approach can feel overwhelming.

You’ll learn how to critically evaluate the sources you’ve already gathered, synthesise information from multiple texts to build coherent arguments, and present your findings in a clear, structured way that demonstrates your understanding of the field.

By the end of the session, you’ll have:

- Understood the purpose of the literature and the process behind it.
- Developed your research questions and identified keywords.
- Considered the scope of your research and how it relates to the field.
- Reviewed techniques for effective note-taking.
- Assessed different structures and critical writing styles.
- Created a personal action plan for moving forward with your literature review.

With the help of an experienced facilitator, you’ll create a strategy that’s right for you and your PhD.

👩🏽‍🎓 **Audience:** PhD researchers at all stages and in any discipline.

⏰ **Duration:** 3 hours
