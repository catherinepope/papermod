Narrative CVs are gaining popularity as a way for researchers to showcase a wider range of skills and experience in grant applications. But what is a narrative CV? And how does it differ from a traditional CV?

This interactive workshop demystifies and simplifies the process of writing a narrative CV. Through discussion, activities, and examples, you‚Äôll learn how best to present your research story.

By the end of the session, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Identify your invisible skills and experience.
- Provide evidence of your experience.
- Translate your experience into the required structure.
- Describe your research using clear and concise language.
- Create a polished and professional narrative CV.

You‚Äôll also get the opportunity to give and receive feedback with other researchers.

With the help of an experienced facilitator, you‚Äôll devise a strategy for writing your own narrative CV.

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì **Audience:** Researchers at all stages and in any discipline.

‚è∞ **Duration:** 3 hours

## Feedback

- "Thank you so much for providing training at this very helpful seminar.  I now have an excellent strategy for structuring writing around storytelling, which will be useful for how I describe my research narrative, as well as for other tasks such as writing journal articles and proposals. I feel more confident about writing a narrative CV as a consequence of this training."
- "I knew very little about narrative CVs prior to this session.  This session has helped me see the value of these, what to include and how to best produce one which will be useful for enhancing my personal profile and for funding bids etc. I really liked that it was across different departments and that the session had time to also make new contacts and get different perspectives into a developing narrative CV."
- "I‚Äôd read around narrative CVs but it was really useful to see examples and understand how to write one in more detail in a supportive environment."
