## Payment

Before confirming a workshop booking, I’ll need a purchase order from you. I operate as an associate of [Research Coach Limited](https://www.researchcoach.co.uk), who handle all the payments. If you haven’t worked with Research Coach before, you’ll need to set them up as a supplier on your financial system. Please start this process at least six weeks before you want your workshop to take place.

Workshop invoices are issued at the end of the month in which the session is delivered.

Payment is via BACS transfer or debit/credit card. All invoices must be paid within 30 days of
the invoice date.

## Cancellation policy

- Workshops cancelled within 28 days of the booked date incur a charge of 50% of the
session price.
- Workshops cancelled within 14 days of the booked date incur a charge of 75% of the
session price.
- Workshops cancelled within 7 days of the booked date incur a charge of 100% of the
session price.

Promotion and bookings are the sole responsibility of the client. If you’re concerned about low numbers, please contact me ASAP so we can discuss either rescheduling the workshop or offering an alternative session.

## Insurance

I hold professional indemnity and public liability insurance. Certificates available on request.

## Accessibility

I am committed to providing an inclusive and accessible environment for all attendees. I have implemented the following measures:

- Slides are circulated at the end of our workshops. Where necessary, these can be provided 48
hours before the session.
- Live captioning is activated in all my Zoom sessions. Participants can enable this feature on their devices.

If you have specific accessibility requirements, please contact me at least 7 working days before the
workshop and provide full details. Without sufficient notice or information, I cannot guarantee my ability to accommodate requests.

## Workshop Etiquette

I want to ensure that everyone gets the most out of my workshops. I ask attendees to:

- Join the workshop at the advertised start time. If anyone joins the session more than 15
minutes late, I reserve the right not to admit them. Otherwise, it’s disruptive for both
the facilitator and participants.
- Ensure they are in a quiet space. Background noise and activities are distracting for
everyone.

My sessions are never recorded, so attendees only benefit from the training by attending the full
session.
