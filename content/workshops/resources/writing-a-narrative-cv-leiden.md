👋 Hello. I'm facilitating the **Writing a Narrative CV** workshop on 17th December (10am-1pm). Here's everything you need to know.

## Before the workshop ✅

In the session, we focus on *writing* a narrative CV, rather than discussing the format. If you're unfamiliar with narrative CVs, please read the following information **before** the workshop. I won't be covering any of the basics on the day:

- [An Introduction to Narrative CVs](../an-introduction-to-narrative-cvs/)
- [What Should You Include in a Narrative CV?](../what-should-you-include-in-a-narrative-cv/)

It would also be helpful for you to read:

- [Using the OCAR structure for academic writing](../using-the-ocar-structure-for-academic-writing/)

You'll be using OCAR to build your narrative.

### What to expect 🧐

In the workshop, I'll start by getting you thinking about your funder's requirements. Then I'll guide you through the steps of writing a narrative CV that supports your proposed project.

By the end of the session, you'll have:

- Drafted at least one complete module section using the OCAR structure.
- Identified your strongest examples across all four modules.
- Understood how to create an overarching narrative for your CV.

### What you'll need 👜

To participate fully in the activities, please bring:

- **Your research history:** A copy of your traditional academic CV, publication list, and notes on activities not typically included (e.g., peer review, mentoring, committee work, public engagement, even organisation).
- **Details of your project idea:** This is to ensure you're including the most relevant examples in your narrative CV.
- **Writing tools:** A laptop/tablet with your preferred writing app and screen space to view workshop materials alongside your writing.

### Questions?

Contact me@catherinepope.com if you have any questions before the workshop.

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to meeting you soon!
