Your Personal Statement is possibly the most challenging part of a narrative CV. In just 2-3 sentences, you need to convey your research identity, your approach, and why you're the right person for the funding. It's not a mini-biography or a list of achievements — it's the distilled essence of your overarching narrative.

How do you compress your entire career into a few sentences? Where do you even start?

In this post, I'll guide you through the process of discovering your research identity and crafting a Personal Statement that accurately and authentically represents who you are as a researcher.

## What Makes a Strong Personal Statement?

A strong Personal Statement for a narrative CV:

- **Articulates your research identity** - not just what you do, but *who you are* as a researcher
- **Conveys your distinctive approach** - what makes your perspective unique
- **Connects to all four modules** - hints at the breadth of your contributions
- **Feels authentic** - uses your voice, not generic academic language
- **Is specific enough to be memorable** - but flexible enough to adapt for different applications

## Finding Your Research Identity

Before you can write your Personal Statement, you need to identify your research identity—the thread that connects everything you do.

**Exercise 1: Complete these sentences**

Write quick, instinctive responses:

- The problems that motivate my research are...
- I'm known among colleagues for...
- If I could change one thing about my field, it would be...
- The word that appears most often in my work is...
- My research approach differs from others because...

**Exercise 2: Look for patterns in your modules**

Review the examples you've gathered for your four modules. Ask:

- What values keep appearing? (e.g., collaboration, accessibility, innovation, equity)
- What kinds of problems do you gravitate toward?
- What's your characteristic way of approaching challenges?
- Who benefits from your work most often?

**Exercise 3: Ask colleagues**

Sometimes others see our patterns more clearly than we do. Ask 2-3 colleagues:

"If you had to describe my research in one sentence, what would you say?"

Their answers often reveal your distinctive contribution.

Only do this if they're definitely familiar with your research! You don't want to put anyone on the spot.

## From Long to Short: The Condensing Process

Don't try to write the 2-3 sentence version first. Start long and work your way down.

LINK WITH OCAR POSTS.


**Step 1: Draft the full OCAR version (3-4 paragraphs)**

Write out your complete research narrative:

- **Opening:** What problem or context has motivated your career?
- **Challenge:** What question or need have you been addressing?
- **Action:** How have you pursued this across your four areas of contribution?
- **Resolution:** What impact has this had? What does it position you to do next?

Don't worry about length yet. Just get the full story down.

**Step 2: Condense to key points (1 paragraph, ~100 words)**

Now identify the absolute essentials:

- Your core commitment/motivation (from Opening)
- Your distinctive approach (from Challenge/Action)
- The breadth of your contributions (touching on all modules)

**Step 3: Refine to 2-3 sentences (~50 words)**

This is the hardest cut. Every word must earn its place. You're aiming for:

- Sentence 1: Your research identity and core commitment
- Sentence 2: What you actually do (touching on your four modules)
- Optional Sentence 3: The impact or unique approach (if essential)

**Example progression:**

**Full OCAR version (320 words):**

"Throughout my career in applied theatre, I've witnessed how mainstream performance spaces and practices often exclude marginalized communities—whether through physical barriers, cultural assumptions, or economic constraints that make participation feel inaccessible or irrelevant. This systemic exclusion means that theatre, which should be a democratic art form, instead reinforces existing inequalities.

How could I develop and advocate for theatre practices that genuinely center the experiences, needs, and creative agency of communities who have been historically excluded from arts participation? This question has driven my work across multiple dimensions.

I have pursued this through interconnected approaches: developing participatory methods that prioritize accessibility, such as visual devising frameworks for Deaf participants (Module 1); creating partnerships with community organizations to bring theatre to underserved populations (Module 4); mentoring early career practitioners in inclusive approaches (Module 2); and advocating within professional networks for more equitable practices in how we organize, document, and share applied theatre work (Module 3).

This sustained commitment to inclusive practice has shaped every aspect of my work—from the methods I develop, to the communities I partner with, to how I contribute to building a more equitable applied theatre sector. These efforts position me to lead projects that require exactly this combination of practice-based innovation, community partnership skills, and commitment to centering marginalized voices."

**Condensed version (48 words):**

"Applied theatre practitioner-researcher committed to creating inclusive performance spaces where marginalized voices can be heard and valued. I develop participatory projects that center community experiences, advocate for accessible theatre practices, and contribute to building a more equitable arts sector."

Notice what stayed and what went:

- ✅ Kept: Core identity, commitment to inclusion, what you actually do
- ❌ Cut: Detailed context, all the "how" details, specific module references, project positioning

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Being too generic**

❌ "Experienced researcher interested in improving health outcomes through innovative methods."

This could describe thousands of researchers. What's *your* distinctive approach?

✅ "Health services researcher committed to translating complex data into actionable insights for under-resourced primary care settings."

**Mistake 2: Listing activities instead of articulating identity**

❌ "I conduct research, supervise PhD students, sit on editorial boards, and engage with policymakers."

This is a to-do list, not an identity.

✅ "Interdisciplinary researcher bridging academic rigor and policy relevance to address health inequalities."

**Mistake 3: Using jargon or overly academic language**

❌ "My research interrogates the epistemological frameworks underpinning methodological approaches to data synthesis."

Save the jargon for your papers. Your Personal Statement should be clear to reviewers from any discipline.

✅ "I develop methods that help researchers synthesize evidence from diverse sources to answer complex questions."

**Mistake 4: Being too modest**

❌ "I try to contribute to making research more accessible where possible."

"Try to" and "where possible" undermine your authority.

✅ "I develop tools and training that democratize access to advanced research methods."

**Mistake 5: Not connecting to the breadth of your work**

❌ "Molecular biologist studying protein folding mechanisms."

This only hints at Module 1. What about your other contributions?

✅ "Molecular biologist investigating protein folding while building collaborative research networks and training the next generation of structural biologists."

**Mistake 6: Looking backward instead of forward**

❌ "Over the past 15 years, I have developed expertise in..."

Your Personal Statement should feel current and forward-looking.

✅ "I develop..." or "I am committed to..." (present tense suggests ongoing work)

## Testing Your Personal Statement

Once you've drafted your Personal Statement, test it:

**The authenticity test:**

- Does this sound like you, or like generic academic speak?
- Would your colleagues recognise you in this description?
- Could you confidently say this out loud when introducing yourself?

**The specificity test:**
- Could this apply to hundreds of other researchers, or is it distinctively yours?
- Does it hint at your unique perspective or approach?

**The comprehensiveness test:**
- Does it touch on multiple areas of contribution, not just your research outputs?
- Could someone reading only this sentence understand the breadth of what you do?

**The relevance test:**
- Does it connect to the funder's priorities?
- Does it position you for the type of project you're proposing?

If your statement fails any of these tests, revise accordingly.

## Adapting for Different Applications

Your core research identity stays consistent, but you'll adjust emphasis for different funders:

**Original version:**
"Applied theatre practitioner-researcher committed to creating inclusive performance spaces where marginalized voices can be heard and valued. I develop participatory projects that center community experiences, advocate for accessible theatre practices, and contribute to building a more equitable arts sector."

**For a community engagement-focused funder:**
"Applied theatre practitioner-researcher committed to co-creating performance with marginalized communities whose voices are often excluded from mainstream arts. I develop participatory projects rooted in community knowledge, build sustainable partnerships, and advocate for equitable arts practices."

**For a methods/innovation-focused funder:**
"Applied theatre practitioner-researcher developing innovative participatory methods that center accessibility and community agency. I create frameworks for inclusive practice, document and share methodologies, and contribute to building evidence-informed approaches in applied theatre."

Notice: Same core identity, different emphasis.

## Examples Across Disciplines

**Early career humanities researcher:**
"Literary scholar examining how 19th-century periodicals shaped public discourse about science and gender. I combine archival research with digital methods, mentor undergraduate researchers, and make historical texts accessible to public audiences through exhibitions and talks."

*What works:* Specific focus, hints at methods innovation (digital), touches on multiple contributions (research, mentoring, public engagement).

**Mid-career STEM researcher:**
"Computational biologist developing machine learning approaches to predict drug interactions. I build open-source tools, foster interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists and clinicians, and train researchers in applying computational methods to biomedical questions."

*What works:* Clear expertise, emphasizes accessibility (open-source), shows breadth (tools, collaboration, training).

**Established social sciences researcher:**
"Education researcher committed to addressing inequalities in access to quality teaching. I conduct longitudinal studies on teacher development, advise policymakers on evidence-based practice, mentor early career researchers, and champion open research methods."

*What works:* Clear mission, demonstrates impact pathway (policy), shows leadership (mentoring, championing methods).

## The Relationship to Your Full Narrative

Your Personal Statement is the most compressed version of your [nested OCAR structure](../using-ocar-at-three-levels/):

- **CV level (Personal Statement):** 2-3 sentences
- **Module level:** 1 paragraph per module connecting examples
- **Individual level:** Full narratives for each contribution

The Personal Statement should emerge naturally from your module-level narratives, not be written in isolation. If you're struggling, go back to your modules and look for the common thread.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the exercises to identify your research identity
2. Draft your full OCAR version (don't start with the short version!)
3. Condense progressively, testing at each stage
4. Review the [annotated narrative CV examples](../) to see Personal Statements in context
5. Read [Using OCAR at Three Levels](../using-ocar-at-three-levels/) to understand how your Personal Statement connects to your full narrative

Your Personal Statement is difficult to write because it requires genuine self-reflection and ruthless editing. But when it works, it immediately tells reviewers who you are as a researcher and why they should fund you. Also, you'll no longer panic when someone asks you to describe your research.
