👉 Important reminders:

- Your narrative CV should reflect your authentic experience and voice.
- Every funder has different requirements - always check current guidelines.
- There's no single "correct" way to structure your narratives.

**Note:** This example uses a 2,000-word limit. Always check your funder's specific requirements. Limits typically range from 1,000-2,000 words.

## Personal Statement

<details class="ocar-breakdown">

<summary>💡 How this Personal Statement emerges from OCAR</summary>

**Extended OCAR version (what you might draft first):**

**Opening:** Throughout my career, I've observed how technical and resource barriers prevent many researchers from engaging with cutting-edge methods and data, limiting innovation and perpetuating inequalities in research capacity.

**Challenge:** How could I develop solutions that democratise access to advanced research tools, methods, and datasets across disciplines and institutions while also fostering inclusive research communities?

**Action:** I have pursued this question through multiple interconnected approaches: developing accessible tools and training resources that democratise advanced methods (Module 1), mentoring and supporting researchers from diverse backgrounds (Module 2), strengthening research community infrastructure through editorial work and advocacy (Module 3), and translating research into policy and community impact (Module 4).

**Resolution:** This sustained commitment to accessibility and inclusion has shaped every aspect of my work — from the technical tools I develop, to the researchers I support, to how I contribute to building more equitable research systems. These efforts position me to lead projects that require exactly this combination of technical innovation, inclusive leadership, and commitment to translating research into real-world impact.

</details>

Throughout my career, I've observed how technical and resource barriers prevent many researchers from engaging with cutting-edge methods and data, limiting innovation and perpetuating inequalities in research capacity. I have developed solutions that democratise access to advanced research tools, methods, and datasets across disciplines and institutions through three interconnected initiatives: creating accessible analysis tools, developing open training resources, and establishing shared data infrastructure.

<details class="ocar-breakdown">

<summary>💡 Individual example OCAR breakdown</summary>

- **Opening:** ML advances transformed data analysis but remain inaccessible to non-programmers.
- **Challenge:** Create an interface allowing non-technical researchers to apply ML methods.
- **Action:** Developed and tested browser-based tool with 50 researchers across 5 disciplines; gathered usability feedback.
- **Resolution:** Enabled researchers to conduct analyses previously requiring specialist skills; approach applicable to other barriers.

</details>

Recent advances in machine learning have transformed how we analyse large datasets, but these tools remain inaccessible to many researchers without programming expertise. I created an interface that allows non-technical researchers to apply machine learning methods to their own data. I developed and tested a browser-based tool with 50 researchers across five disciplines. Participants completed analysis tasks and provided feedback on usability. My tool enabled researchers to conduct analyses previously requiring specialist skills, thereby democratising access to advanced methods. This approach could be applied to other technical barriers in research.

- **Action:** Co-organised seminar series with diverse speakers; facilitated small-group discussions.
- **Resolution:** Engaged ~30 ECRs per seminar with positive feedback; 3 secured positions crediting the seminars.

</details>

Early career researchers in our department faced significant uncertainty about career options beyond academia. As a member of the departmental ECR committee, I co-organised a career development seminar series to provide authentic insights into diverse career paths and help ECRs envision concrete next steps. I invited diverse speakers from the pharmaceutical industry and university professional services to share their experiences and facilitated small-group discussions after each session. The initiative engaged ~30 ECRs per seminar, with feedback noting the sessions were "informative and inspiring". Three participants subsequently secured positions in the sectors we featured, directly crediting the seminars for their career transitions.

- **Challenge:** Create supportive structure for students to learn from each other, building skills and community.
- **Action:** Designed peer mentoring scheme pairing years 1-2; developed framework; trained mentors; held reflection sessions.
- **Resolution:** 20 students participated over 2 years; increased confidence, reduced isolation; adopted department-wide; toolkit adapted by 3 institutions.

</details>

PhD students in our research group often struggled in isolation with similar challenges — from experimental troubleshooting to thesis writing — without realising their peers had relevant experience to share. I designed and piloted a peer mentoring scheme pairing second-year PhD students with those in their first year, creating a supportive structure where students could learn from each other's experiences while building both skills and community. I developed a framework of monthly structured meetings with suggested topics, trained mentors in active listening, and held quarterly reflection sessions to gather feedback and refine the approach. Over two years, 20 students participated, with mentees reporting increased confidence and reduced feelings of isolation. The scheme has now been adopted department-wide, and I created a toolkit that three other institutions have adapted.

- **Opening:** Researchers with caring responsibilities face invisible barriers to full participation.
- **Challenge:** Create environment where they can contribute fully without compromising wellbeing.
- **Action:** Established working group; audited practices; developed accommodations (core hours, virtual options, childcare fund); mentored 3 researchers through parental leave.
- **Resolution:** 40% increase in feeling supported; 2 mentees published during leave; 1 secured fellowship crediting planning sessions.

</details>

Researchers with caring responsibilities — whether for children, elderly parents, or disabled family members — often face invisible barriers to full participation in research activities, particularly those scheduled outside standard hours or requiring travel. I established a working group to audit our departmental practices and create an environment where researchers with caring responsibilities could contribute fully without compromising their wellbeing or career progression. We developed practical accommodations: introducing core hours for mandatory meetings, providing virtual participation options for all seminars, and creating a departmental fund for emergency childcare during essential travel. I also mentored three researchers navigating parental leave, helping them plan transitions and maintain research momentum. Department feedback surveys showed a 40% increase in researchers with caring responsibilities feeling supported. Two mentees successfully published during their parental leave transitions, and one secured a fellowship immediately upon return, crediting our planning sessions with enabling this success.

## Module 3: Impact on wider research and innovation community

<details class="ocar-breakdown">

<summary>💡 Module-level OCAR breakdown</summary>

- **Opening:** Research communities need robust infrastructure, but essential functions rely on invisible labour.
- **Challenge:** How to meaningfully strengthen community infrastructure across multiple dimensions.
- **Action:** Took on peer review/editorial roles, championed inclusive practices via committees, helped establish standards.
- **Resolution:** (shown at end of module).

</details>

Throughout my career, I've observed how research communities function most effectively when they have robust infrastructure for knowledge exchange, quality assurance, and inclusive participation. However, these essential community functions often rely on invisible labour that goes unrecognised. I have strengthened research community infrastructure across multiple dimensions — from scholarly communication to diversity and methodological rigour — by taking on strategic roles in peer review and editorial work, championing inclusive practices through committee leadership, and helping establish community standards for emerging research methods.

<details class="ocar-breakdown">

- **Opening:** Journals struggle to find reviewers with interdisciplinary expertise, causing delays and inadequate assessment.
- **Challenge:** Contribute cross-disciplinary expertise while training next generation of reviewers.
- **Action:** Completed 15-20 reviews annually for 5 journals; served as Associate Editor 3 years handling 40+ manuscripts; mentored 4 ECRs; developed review guidance.
- **Resolution:** Reduced decision times by 25%; authors praised developmental feedback; 3 mentees now regular reviewers; guidance shared with all new reviewers.

</details>

As interdisciplinary research methods become increasingly complex, journals struggle to find reviewers with sufficient breadth of expertise, leading to delays and sometimes inadequate quality assessment. I addressed this by contributing my cross-disciplinary expertise to strengthen peer review while training the next generation of reviewers. I completed 15-20 peer reviews annually for five leading journals across my field, consistently meeting deadlines and providing constructive, developmental feedback. I also served as Associate Editor for \[Journal Name] for three years, handling 40+ manuscripts and mentoring four early career researchers through shadowing reviews. I developed a guidance document on writing constructive reviews that the journal now shares with all new reviewers. My editorial work reduced average decision times by 25%, and feedback from authors consistently praised the developmental quality of reviews. Three of my mentees have now become regular reviewers themselves, extending the impact of the training approach.

<summary>💡 Individual example OCAR breakdown</summary>

- **Opening:** Department lacked specific support for neurodiverse researchers, creating barriers to participation.
- **Challenge:** Transform culture to actively support neurodiverse colleagues, not just accommodate them.
- **Action:** Identified gap; initiated and led working group; consulted staff/students; conducted audit; created implementation plans.
- **Resolution:** Created good practice guide, HR training, quiet spaces; guide adopted by 2 departments; featured in institutional showcase.

</details>

Despite increasing awareness of diversity issues, our department lacked specific support for neurodiverse researchers and staff, creating barriers to full participation and potential contributions. As a committed member of the department EDI committee, I proactively identified this gap, then initiated and led a dedicated working group on neurodiversity to transform our departmental culture to actively support neurodiverse colleagues rather than simply accommodating them when issues arose. I brought together stakeholders from across the department to develop practical, actionable solutions. We consulted with neurodiverse staff and students, conducted an environmental audit, and created implementation plans with clear accountability. This focused effort yielded tangible improvements to our departmental culture, including a comprehensive good practice guide for organising inclusive departmental events, specialised training for HR staff, and quiet spaces for focused work. The guide has since been adopted by two other departments and featured in our institution's EDI best practice showcase.

- **Opening:** Field lacked consensus on metadata standards, making it difficult to share data usefully.
- **Challenge:** Develop community-wide standards balancing rigour with practicality for diverse contexts.
- **Action:** Joined national working group; contributed to drafting; led consultation with 60+ researchers; co-authored guidelines; piloted in own lab; created template.
- **Resolution:** Standards adopted by Research Council, required for all projects; template downloaded 500+ times; delivered 3 training workshops; improved data discoverability.

</details>

As research data sharing becomes increasingly expected by funders and publishers, our field lacked clear consensus on metadata standards, making it difficult for researchers to share data in ways that others could actually use. I joined a national working group convened by \[Research Council] to develop community-wide standards that balanced rigour with practicality, ensuring adoption across diverse research contexts. I brought expertise in both data management and research practice, and over 18 months contributed to drafting proposed standards, led consultation workshops with 60+ researchers to gather feedback, and co-authored the final guidelines document. I also piloted the standards in my own lab and created a template and checklist to simplify implementation. The standards were formally adopted by \[Research Council] and are now required for all funded projects in our domain. My implementation template has been downloaded 500+ times, and I've delivered three invited workshops training researchers in applying the standards. This work has measurably improved data discoverability and reuse across our field.

</details>

Residents in \[specific community/neighbourhood] experienced disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, but had limited access to evidence-based prevention information tailored to their cultural context and practical circumstances. I partnered with \[Community Organization] to co-create health promotion resources that respected community knowledge while incorporating research evidence, ensuring they would actually be used and trusted. We established a collaborative project involving community health workers and residents as co-researchers. Over 12 months, we conducted focus groups, co-designed culturally appropriate materials, and piloted interventions in community settings. I secured £15,000 from \[Funder] to support the partnership and trained five community members in data collection methods. The resulting toolkit of health resources is now used by 20 community centres across the region, reaching an estimated 2,000 residents annually. The community organisation reported that residents found the materials "relevant and trustworthy" because they reflected lived experience. Two community co-researchers have since been employed as health advocates, extending the project's reach and sustainability.
