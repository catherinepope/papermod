This template shows the structure of a narrative CV with space for planning your OCAR elements. Copy and paste into your preferred writing app and adapt as needed — you might need fewer or more examples per module depending on your word limit.

⚠️ Remember: these bullet points are for planning. Your final narrative CV should be written in full prose paragraphs, not bullet points!
