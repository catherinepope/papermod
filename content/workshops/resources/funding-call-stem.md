This is a **fictitious** funding call for the [Writing a Narrative CV](../writing-a-narrative-cv/) workshop. Use the guidelines below to draft your own narrative CV. What examples could you include in each module that reflect the priorities of this funding body? Remember: you can include non-academic examples, e.g. voluntary work.

💡 For inspiration, [take a look at this sample CV](../narrative-cv-example-stem/).

## The Research Accessibility and Innovation Fund

**Funder:** Science & Technology Research Council (STRC)

**Award amount:** £50,000 - £100,000

**Duration:** 12-24 months

**Eligibility:** Researchers at any career stage working in STEM fields at UK institutions

### Purpose

The Research Accessibility and Innovation Fund supports projects that democratise access to advanced research methods, tools, and data while fostering inclusive research practices. We particularly welcome projects that:

- Develop tools or resources that make advanced methods accessible to under-resourced researchers or communities.
- Address technical, resource, or knowledge barriers that create inequalities in research capacity.
- Create innovative training or infrastructure that enables broader participation in research.
- Build sustainable collaborations across institutions, sectors, or disciplines.
- Produce open-access outputs that benefit the wider research community.

### What we're looking for

We seek researchers who can demonstrate:

- **Commitment to accessibility:** Evidence of developing solutions that reduce barriers to participation in research.
- **Inclusive practice:** Track record of supporting researchers from diverse backgrounds and career stages.
- **Methodological innovation:** Creative approaches to making complex methods, tools, or data more accessible.
- **Sustainable impact:** Plans for maintaining resources and relationships beyond the funding period.
- **Cross-context communication:** Ability to work across disciplines, sectors, and with diverse stakeholders.

### Priority areas (2025-2026)

We are particularly interested in projects addressing:

- Open science tools and infrastructure.
- Training resources for emerging research methods.
- Data sharing and accessibility.
- Inclusive research environments and practices.
- Public engagement with complex scientific topics.

### Application requirements

Applications must include:

- Project proposal (maximum 2,000 words)
- **Narrative CV** (maximum 2,000 words covering the four R4RI modules)
- Letters of support from partner organisations (where applicable)
- Budget and timeline

### Assessment criteria

Your narrative CV will be assessed on:

- Relevant technical expertise and research experience.
- Track record of developing accessible tools, resources, or training.
- Commitment to inclusive and equitable research practices.
- Contribution to building research community capacity.
- Ability to communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences.
