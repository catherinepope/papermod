- Creates coherence: the OCAR structure transforms disconnected achievements into a coherent narrative.
- Emphasises problem-solving: by describing challenges and their resolution, you showcase your innovative thinking.
- Demonstrates impact: the Resolution component naturally focuses attention on outcomes rather than just activities.
- Shows progression: OCAR naturally creates a sense of development and growth in your research journey.   
- Makes contributions memorable: Reviewers are more likely to remember your achievements when presented as stories rather than lists.
