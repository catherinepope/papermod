## Team Statement

Interdisciplinary research team combining creative practice, environmental science, and community engagement expertise to address climate justice through collaborative storytelling. We develop participatory arts projects that center marginalized voices in climate discourse, create innovative methods for translating complex environmental data into accessible narratives, and build sustainable partnerships between researchers, artists, and frontline communities. Our collective approach bridges academic rigor with creative practice and community knowledge to foster climate action grounded in equity and lived experience.

<details class="ocar-breakdown">
<summary>💡 How this Personal Statement derives from OCAR</summary>

**Extended OCAR version (what you might draft first):**

**Opening:** Climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, yet these voices are often absent from climate discourse and decision-making. Traditional approaches to climate communication struggle to convey both the urgency and the human dimensions of environmental crisis in ways that foster meaningful action.

**Challenge:** How can we center the experiences and knowledge of frontline communities in climate discourse while creating accessible, emotionally resonant narratives that bridge scientific understanding with lived experience and inspire equitable climate action?

**Action:** Our team brings together complementary expertise: Dr. Martinez's creative practice in participatory theatre and community arts (Module 1, 4); Dr. Chen's environmental data visualization and accessible science communication (Module 1, 4); Dr. Okafor's community-engaged research and equitable partnership methodologies (Module 2, 4); and Early Career Researcher Jamie Williams's experience in inclusive research practices and digital storytelling (Module 1, 2, 3). Together, we have developed arts-based methods for climate communication, built authentic community partnerships, supported diverse researchers, and contributed to more inclusive approaches within our respective fields.

**Resolution:** This combination of creative practice, environmental expertise, community engagement methods, and inclusive research approaches positions us uniquely to lead projects requiring both artistic innovation and scientific rigor, authentic community partnership and academic credibility, and commitment to centering justice and equity in climate action.

## Module 1: Generation & flow of new ideas

Our team has collectively recognized that climate communication often fails to engage diverse audiences because it relies heavily on abstract data and technical language that alienates rather than connects. We wanted to develop innovative methods that translate complex environmental information into emotionally resonant narratives while honoring the knowledge and experiences of communities most affected by climate change. We have pursued this through three complementary approaches: creating participatory performance methodologies, developing accessible data visualization tools, and establishing frameworks for integrating community knowledge with scientific evidence.

Communities facing environmental injustice often lack creative platforms to share their experiences of climate impacts, while climate researchers struggle to communicate the human dimensions of environmental data. Dr. Martinez wanted to develop a performance methodology that could capture both the emotional weight of climate impacts and the resilience of affected communities. Working with a coastal community experiencing flooding and displacement, she developed "Climate Witness Theatre," a participatory devising approach that transforms residents' testimonies into powerful performance pieces. Over 18 months, she facilitated workshops with 25 community members (aged 16-78), creating three performances attended by 200+ audience members including local council members and regional policymakers. The methodology was documented and published as an open-access toolkit [DOI], and has since been adapted by four other community organizations working on environmental justice. Feedback highlighted how the approach "gave voice to experiences policymakers needed to hear."

Environmental datasets on air quality, temperature changes, and pollution levels are typically presented in formats inaccessible to non-specialists, limiting community understanding and engagement with local environmental issues. Dr. Chen wanted to create visualization tools that make complex environmental data immediately comprehensible while maintaining scientific accuracy. She developed an open-source data visualization platform specifically designed for community use, allowing residents to explore hyperlocal environmental data through interactive maps and timelines. The platform was piloted with three environmental justice organizations representing 5,000+ community members. Dr. Chen provided training to 15 community organizers on using the tools for advocacy. The platform has been accessed 12,000+ times and was cited in two community-led planning consultations, with organizers reporting it "transformed how we could advocate with evidence."

Academic research often treats community knowledge as supplementary to scientific evidence, creating hierarchies that undervalue lived experience. Dr. Okafor and Jamie Williams wanted to establish a methodological framework that genuinely integrates community observations with scientific monitoring as equal forms of evidence. Together, they developed and tested a "Parallel Evidence Framework" through a 12-month project with an urban community concerned about industrial pollution. The framework structured community environmental observations alongside scientific air quality monitoring, creating datasets that honored both knowledge systems. They published the methodology in Environmental Justice Research [DOI] and presented findings at the Community-Based Participatory Research conference. Three research teams have subsequently adopted the framework, and one community group used it to successfully petition for additional environmental monitoring in their area.

## Module 2: Development of others

Our team has observed how early career researchers working at the intersection of arts, science, and community engagement often struggle to find mentorship that understands the unique challenges of transdisciplinary, community-based work. Traditional academic structures privilege single-discipline expertise and individual achievement, leaving researchers who work collaboratively or across boundaries feeling isolated. We wanted to create supportive structures and opportunities that would help early career researchers develop confidence in transdisciplinary practice while building inclusive research communities. We have established peer networks, provided targeted mentorship, and created professional development opportunities that honor diverse research pathways.

Postgraduate students pursuing practice-based environmental research felt uncertain about how to balance artistic practice with scientific rigor, and how to articulate the value of creative methods to skeptical academic audiences. Dr. Martinez initiated a quarterly "Art-Science Methods" seminar series, inviting established researchers working at disciplinary intersections to share their experiences and strategies. She organized eight seminars over two years, engaging 40+ students across five institutions. Students could attend virtually, making it accessible to those at institutions without strong art-science programs. Jamie Williams co-facilitated discussion sessions, bringing a near-peer perspective that helped students see viable career pathways. Post-seminar surveys showed 90% of participants felt "more confident articulating the value of creative research methods," and four students reported the series directly influenced their thesis methodologies.

Community partners who participated in research projects often expressed interest in developing their own research skills but lacked access to traditional academic training pathways. Dr. Okafor wanted to create accessible research training specifically designed for community members wanting to conduct their own environmental justice research. She developed and delivered a six-week "Community Research Methods" course through a local community center, attended by 12 residents ranging in age from 22 to 67. The course covered research design, ethical considerations, data collection, and advocacy strategies, using environmental justice examples throughout. Dr. Chen contributed two sessions on data analysis and visualization. Ten participants completed the course, with three going on to lead their own community research projects and one enrolling in a part-time master's program, citing the course as "opening doors I didn't know existed."

Early career researchers from working-class backgrounds or first-generation university students often face additional financial and cultural barriers to participating fully in research communities, particularly when conferences require travel and registration fees. Jamie Williams, drawing on their own experience as a first-generation scholar, initiated a "Conference Support Fund" within their department, advocating for £2,000 annual funding to support ECR conference attendance. They established application criteria prioritizing researchers from underrepresented backgrounds and created a mentorship component where recipients received pre-conference preparation support. Over two years, the fund supported 8 early career researchers in attending conferences, with all recipients presenting their work and six reporting that attendance "significantly expanded their professional networks." The model has since been adopted by two other departments at the institution.

## Module 3: Impact on wider research and innovation community

Our team has recognized that arts-based environmental research remains marginalized in both traditional science spaces and in arts/humanities communities, creating challenges for researchers working at these intersections. Academic structures, funding mechanisms, and publication venues often struggle to accommodate transdisciplinary work that doesn't fit conventional categories. We wanted to contribute to building more inclusive infrastructure that recognizes and supports arts-science environmental research as a legitimate and valuable approach. We have taken on leadership roles in professional organizations, advocated for inclusive practices, and helped establish standards and spaces for transdisciplinary environmental research.

The Environmental Research Network, a key professional organization in our field, held conferences primarily featuring traditional scientific presentations, with creative or participatory methods relegated to poster sessions or fringe events. Dr. Martinez and Dr. Chen jointly proposed and organized a new conference strand called "Creative Climate Communication" as members of the conference planning committee. They curated three sessions featuring performances, interactive installations, and data visualizations alongside traditional presentations. The strand attracted 100+ attendees—the highest attendance of any parallel session—and received enthusiastic feedback with 85% of evaluations noting it "expanded my understanding of what environmental research can be." The strand is now a permanent conference feature, and two other environmental research organizations have contacted them about establishing similar programming.

Peer reviewers for environmental justice journals often lacked frameworks for assessing community-engaged and arts-based research, sometimes applying inappropriate criteria that privileged traditional scientific methods. Dr. Okafor wanted to develop clearer guidance for evaluating participatory and creative environmental research. When invited to join the editorial board of Community Environmental Research, she proposed and led the development of supplementary review guidelines specifically for community-engaged and creative methodologies. She convened a working group of six researchers (including Dr. Martinez) to draft the guidelines, incorporating feedback from community research partners. The guidelines were adopted by the journal and published as an open-access resource [DOI], subsequently being adapted by two other journals. Reviewers reported the guidelines "clarified how to assess rigor in participatory work" and increased confidence in reviewing non-traditional submissions.

Early career researchers working on arts-science environmental projects struggled to find professional networks that understood their transdisciplinary focus, often feeling they didn't fully belong in either arts or science communities. Jamie Williams identified this gap and established an informal online network called "Arts-Science-Community Connectors," creating a Slack workspace for researchers, artists, and community organizers working at these intersections. They organized monthly virtual meetups featuring project showcases and peer support discussions. Over 18 months, the network grew to 75 members across 12 institutions, with members reporting it provided "crucial connection with others doing similar work." Three collaborative grant applications emerged from network connections, and members organized two joint symposia. The network continues to grow, with Williams mentoring two other early career researchers to share facilitation responsibilities.

## Module 4: Impact on broader society

Our team shares a commitment to ensuring that environmental research and creative practice directly benefit communities experiencing climate injustice. However, academic outputs often remain inaccessible to the communities most affected by environmental issues, and climate policy discussions frequently exclude voices of frontline communities. We wanted to ensure our work translated into tangible benefits for communities facing environmental challenges while amplifying marginalized voices in climate discourse. We have developed community partnerships, influenced local environmental policy, and created accessible public resources that center justice and equity.

A low-income neighborhood adjacent to an industrial estate experienced concerning health symptoms residents suspected were linked to air pollution, but lacked resources to investigate or advocate effectively. Dr. Chen and Dr. Okafor partnered with the residents' association to establish a collaborative air quality monitoring project. Over 12 months, they trained 15 residents in using low-cost monitoring equipment and interpreting data, while Dr. Chen created a neighborhood-specific data dashboard making findings immediately visible to the community. Residents collected data at 20 locations, documenting pollution levels exceeding safe thresholds near industrial sites. The team supported residents in presenting evidence to the local council, with Dr. Martinez helping design a creative presentation combining data with resident testimonies. The council subsequently mandated additional monitoring by the industrial estate and committed £50,000 to air quality improvements. Residents reported feeling "finally heard" and two trained monitors have continued advocacy work with other environmental justice groups.

Public discourse about climate change often focuses on polar bears and distant glaciers, failing to connect with urban audiences or convey how climate impacts affect daily life in UK cities. Dr. Martinez wanted to create accessible public performances that made climate change feel immediate and locally relevant. She developed "Climate in Our Streets," a series of short site-specific performances presented in public spaces across three cities, each addressing local climate impacts (flooding, heat vulnerability, air quality). The performances, created with local residents and presented free of charge, were attended by 500+ people who wouldn't typically engage with climate information. Dr. Chen designed accompanying info graphics displayed at performance sites, translating local climate data into accessible formats. Post-performance surveys showed 78% of audiences reported "better understanding how climate change affects my community" and 65% took at least one action afterward (from signing petitions to attending council meetings). The project received coverage in three regional newspapers, extending reach to an estimated 50,000 additional residents.

Teachers in schools serving high-deprivation areas wanted to address climate change in their curriculum but felt overwhelmed by the complexity and lacked age-appropriate resources connecting global issues to local contexts. Jamie Williams, working with Dr. Chen and community partners, developed a free educational toolkit called "Climate Stories from Our Communities" specifically designed for Key Stage 3 students in urban settings. The toolkit combined local climate data visualizations, creative writing prompts based on community testimonies, and guidance for student-led local investigations. They piloted the resource with six schools reaching 400+ students, provided teacher training workshops, and published the toolkit as a free download with accompanying video tutorials. The toolkit has been downloaded 800+ times, and teachers reported it "made climate education feel achievable and relevant to our students' lives." Five schools initiated student-led climate action projects as direct results of using the resource.
