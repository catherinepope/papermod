👋 Hello. I'm facilitating the **Writing a Narrative CV** workshop on 5th December (10am-1pm). Here's everything you need to know.

## Before the workshop ✅

In the session, we focus on *writing* a narrative CV, rather than discussing the format. If you're unfamiliar with narrative CVs, please read the following information **before** the workshop. I won't be covering any of the basics on the day:

- [An Introduction to Narrative CVs](../an-introduction-to-narrative-cvs/)
- [What Should You Include in a Narrative CV?](../what-should-you-include-in-a-narrative-cv/)

It would also be helpful for you to read:

- [Using the OCAR structure for academic writing](../using-the-ocar-structure-for-academic-writing/)

You'll be using OCAR to build your narrative.

### What to expect 🧐

In the workshop, I'll introduce a fictitious funding call. Then I'll guide you through the steps of writing a narrative CV that supports your proposed project. Even if you're not apply for funding, this framework will help you describe your practice to academic audiences.

By the end of the session, you'll have:

- Drafted at least one complete module section using the OCAR structure.
- Identified your strongest examples across all four modules.
- Understood how to create an overarching narrative for your CV.

### What you'll need 👜

To participate fully in the activities, please bring:

- **Your research history:** A copy of your traditional academic CV, publication list, and notes on activities not typically included (e.g., peer review, mentoring, committee work, public engagement).
- **A project idea:** This can be vague! You just need a general sense of what kind of project you might propose. We're only covering the narrative CV, not the full proposal.
- **Writing tools:** A laptop/tablet with your preferred writing app and screen space to view workshop materials alongside your writing.

### Questions?

Contact me@catherinepope.com if you have any questions before the workshop.

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to meeting you soon!
