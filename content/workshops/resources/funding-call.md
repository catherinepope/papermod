>This is a fictitious funding call for the [Writing a Narrative CV](../writing-a-narrative-cv/) workshop. Use the guidelines below to draft your own narrative CV. What examples could you include in each module that reflect the priorities of this funding body? Remember: you can include non-academic examples, e.g. voluntary work.

## The Community Knowledge Exchange Fund

**Funder:** Arts & Humanities Research Futures (AHRF)

**Award amount:** £75,000 - £100,000

**Duration:** 12-24 months

**Eligibility:** Researchers at any career stage working in arts, humanities, or creative practice-based fields at UK institutions.

### Purpose

The Community Knowledge Exchange Fund supports projects that bridge academic research and community knowledge, creating meaningful collaborations that benefit both partners. We particularly welcome projects that:

- Co-create knowledge with communities who have been underrepresented in research.
- Challenge traditional hierarchies between academic and community expertise.
- Develop innovative methods for participatory research or creative practice.
- Build sustainable relationships beyond the funding period.
- Produce outputs accessible to non-academic audiences.

### What we're looking for

We seek researchers who can demonstrate:

- **Authentic community partnerships:** Evidence of genuine co-creation rather than extraction of community knowledge.
- **Inclusive practice:** Commitment to accessibility and working with diverse communities.
- **Methodological innovation:** Creative approaches to bridging academic and community ways of knowing.
- **Sustainable impact:** Plans for legacy beyond the funded period.
- **Communication skills:** Ability to work across different contexts and audiences.

### Priority areas (2025-2026)

We are particularly interested in projects addressing:

- Digital exclusion and technology access.
- Climate justice and environmental sustainability.
- Health inequalities and wellbeing.
- Cultural heritage and community memory.
- Social cohesion in diverse communities.

### Application requirements

Applications must include:

- Project proposal (maximum 2,000 words)
- **Narrative CV** (maximum 2,000 words covering the four R4RI modules)
- Letters of support from community partners
- Budget and timeline

### Assessment criteria

Your narrative CV will be assessed on:

- Relevant research and practice experience.
- Track record of community engagement and co-creation.
- Commitment to inclusive and accessible practice.
- Contribution to building research community capacity.
- Ability to communicate across academic and community contexts.
