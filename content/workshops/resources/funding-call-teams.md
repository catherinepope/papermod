## The Collaborative Arts Research Initiative

**Funder:** Arts & Humanities Research Futures (AHRF)

**Award amount:** £150,000 - £250,000

**Duration:** 24-36 months

**Eligibility:** Research teams of 3-6 members working in arts, humanities, or creative practice-based fields at UK institutions. Teams must include researchers at different career stages.

### Purpose

The Collaborative Arts Research Initiative supports ambitious team projects that combine complementary expertise to address complex cultural, social, or creative challenges through collaborative research. We particularly welcome projects that:

- Bring together researchers with diverse disciplinary perspectives and methodological approaches.
- Include researchers at different career stages, creating opportunities for mentorship and leadership development.
- Co-create knowledge with communities who have been under-represented in research.
- Develop innovative collaborative methodologies for arts and humanities research.
- Build sustainable research partnerships beyond the funding period.
- Produce outputs accessible to both academic and non-academic audiences.

### What we're looking for in your team

We seek research teams who can demonstrate:

- **Complementary expertise:** Clear articulation of what each team member uniquely contributes and why this combination is essential for the project.
- **Inclusive collaboration:** Evidence of supporting diverse perspectives and career stages within the team structure.
- **Community partnerships:** Authentic engagement with communities as research partners, not just participants.
- **Methodological innovation:** Creative collaborative approaches to research questions.
- **Sustainable impact:** Plans for maintaining partnerships and continuing research beyond the funding period.
- **Leadership development:** Opportunities for early career researchers to develop leadership skills.

### Priority areas (2025-2026)

We are particularly interested in projects addressing:

- Digital exclusion and technology access in cultural participation.
- Climate justice and environmental sustainability through creative practice.
- Health inequalities and wellbeing through arts-based interventions.
- Cultural heritage and community memory in diverse communities.
- Social cohesion through collaborative creative practice.

### Application requirements

Applications must include:

- Project proposal (maximum 3,000 words)
- **Team narrative CV** (maximum 2,000 words covering the four R4RI modules for the team as a whole)
- Individual CVs for all team members (maximum 2 pages each, traditional format)
- Letters of support from community partners
- Clear explanation of team roles and governance structure
- Budget and timeline

### Assessment criteria

Your team narrative CV will be assessed on:

- Collective expertise relevant to the proposed project.
- Complementary skills and perspectives across the team.
- Track record of inclusive and collaborative research practice.
- Evidence of community engagement and co-creation across team members.
- Commitment to supporting researchers at different career stages.
- Ability to communicate across academic, community, and public contexts.

### Notes on the team narrative CV 📝

The team narrative CV should:

- Demonstrate the **collective strengths** of the team, not simply list individual achievements.
- Show how team members' contributions **complement each other** and create capabilities greater than the sum of parts.
- Include examples from across the team that demonstrate the **breadth of relevant experience**.
- Clearly attribute contributions (e.g., "Team member X led...", "In collaboration with...").
- Emphasise examples most relevant to **this specific project**, rather than trying to represent all team members equally.
