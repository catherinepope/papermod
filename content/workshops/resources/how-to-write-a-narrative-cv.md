As discussed [in the previous post](../what-should-you-include-in-a-narrative-cv/), for each narrative CV, you need to identify your audience and gather relevant examples. Now it's time to start writing. [OCAR (Opening, Challenge, Action, Resolution)](../using-the-ocar-structure-for-academic-writing/) provides a framework for turning your achievements into compelling narratives that show how and why, not just what.

In this post, we'll explore a step-by-step method and some examples for the four modules.

## Writing your narrative

### Step 1: Choose your achievement

- Pick something relevant to this specific application.
- Make sure it demonstrates the right competencies for this module.

### Step 2: Identify your OCAR elements

- Use the questions from [the OCAR guide](../using-the-ocar-structure-for-academic-writing/) as prompts.
- Make rough notes for each element.
- Check: Does your Resolution link back to your Opening?

### Step 3: Draft your narrative

- Write it out in full sentences.
- Focus on clarity first, elegance later.
- Include specific details (numbers, names, outcomes) - a narrative CV is a story, backed up with facts.

### Step 4: Refine for concision

- Every word must earn its place. 
- Remove any redundancy (e.g. use "regularly", rather than "on a regular basis").
- Check word count against funder requirements.

## Narrative Examples

Here are fictitious examples from the four modules. You'll see the bullet point summary from a traditional CV, followed by a narrative equivalent showing the OCAR structure.

### Module 1: Generation & flow of new ideas

#### Traditional CV

"Co-authored analysis of effects of [B and C] on health outcomes using \[method A] \[DOI]. Cited XXX times. Research led to \[funder] award of $amount for \[E] consortium."

#### Narrative CV

"Health researchers had long struggled to establish clear connections between [B and C] and patient outcomes due to fragmented datasets and methodological limitations (Opening). This critical knowledge gap hindered both clinical decision-making and policy development in addressing these significant health determinants (Challenge). I addressed this challenge by completing a complex data integration using [method A] and coauthoring an innovative early analysis of the effects of \[B and C] on health outcomes \[DOI],introducing a novel approach to synthesizing previously disconnected evidence (Action).This foundational study (cited XXX times since X year) catalysed significant field advancement, serving as the cornerstone for a series of research community workshops organised by \[organisation D], ultimately securing a substantial \[funder] award of $amount for the \[E] consortium to extend this work and implement findings at scale(Resolution)."

### Module 2: Development of others

#### Traditional CV

"Co-organized career development seminar series, 2023-2024"

#### Narrative CV

Early career researchers in our department faced significant uncertainty about career options  beyond academia (Opening). Recognising this knowledge gap could lead to talent loss and missed opportunities for cross-sector collaboration (Challenge), I took initiative as a member of the department of X early career researcher committee to co-organize a strategic career development seminar series, personally inviting diverse speakers from the pharmaceutical industry and university professional services to share authentic career pathway experiences (Action). This initiative successfully engaged ~30 ECRs per seminar, with feedback specifically noting the sessions were ‘informative and inspiring,’ thereby expanding professional networks and helping researchers envision concrete next steps in their career development (Resolution).

### Module 3: Wider research and innovation community

#### Traditional CV

"Member of department X Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity committee. Led working group on neurodiversity. Produced good practice guide for inclusive events and HR training materials."

#### Narrative CV

"Despite increasing awareness of diversity issues, our department lacked specific support for neurodiverse researchers and staff, creating barriers to full participation and potential contributions (Opening). The absence of tailored accommodations and understanding of neurodiversity needs was limiting talented individuals’ ability to thrive in our academic environment and contributing to feelings of exclusion (Challenge). As a committed member of the department X Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity committee, I proactively identified this gap and initiated and led a dedicated working group on neurodiversity, bringing together stakeholders from across the department to develop practical, actionable solutions (Action). This focused effort yielded tangible improvements to our departmental culture, including the creation of a comprehensive good practice guide for organising inclusive departmental events and the implementation of specialised training opportunities for HR staff, transforming how our department supports neurodiverse colleagues (Resolution)."

### Module 4: Broader society

#### Traditional CV

"Research into \[A] and clinical effectiveness of \[B] for [condition C]. Evidence cited by NICE in \[date] recommendation for cost-saving treatment option."

#### Narrative CV

"Patients suffering from \[condition C], which affects \[XX] individuals across the UK, had limited effective treatment options, often relying on suboptimal approaches (Opening). Standard treatments like \[C] frequently resulted in inadequate symptom management, reduced quality of life, and placed significant financial burden on both patients and healthcare systems (Challenge). My rigorous research into \[A] systematically investigated and documented the clinical effectiveness of the alternative approach \[B], providing critical scientific evidence through carefully designed studies that quantified both improved patient outcomes and economic advantages (Action). This evidence was formally appraised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in \[date] and directly contributed to their authoritative recommendation that [B] represents a cost-saving option for treating patients who would otherwise be offered \[C], fundamentally changing treatment pathways and improving care for thousands of patients nationwide (Resolution)."

## Refining your narrative

Once you've drafted narratives for several examples, step back and look at them as a whole. What story are they telling together? What themes or qualities emerge across your work?

Your overarching narrative is the thread that connects your individual examples and explains why you're the right person for this specific project. It might be something like "bridging disciplines to solve complex problems," "translating research into policy impact," or "building inclusive research communities."

This overarching theme should be:

- Relevant to the funder's priorities and the project you're proposing.
- Authentic to your actual experience and approach.
- Evident across multiple modules (not just one area of contribution).

Once you've identified your theme, you can refine your individual narratives to foreground the aspects that strengthen this story. For example, if your theme is about collaborative problem-solving, you might emphasise the partnerships and stakeholder engagement in your examples. If it's about methodological innovation, you'd highlight the novel approaches you developed.

This theme also helps you create the "Personal Statement" section of your narrative CV.

This is an iterative process. You'll draft, identify themes, refine, and adjust as you see how your examples work together. In the Writing Your Narrative CV  workshop, we work through this refinement process in detail, helping you identify your strongest narratives and craft them into a cohesive application.

## Conclusion

Admittedly, writing a narrative CV is more demanding than listing achievements in a traditional format. But it's also an opportunity to showcase the full breadth and impact of your work. By using the OCAR structure, you can transform bare facts into compelling stories that demonstrate not just what you've achieved, but how and why it matters.

Remember:

- Start with [relevant examples for each module](../what-should-you-include-in-a-narrative-cv/).
- [Use OCAR]((../using-the-ocar-structure-for-academic-writing/)) to structure each narrative.
- Look for the overarching theme that connects your work.
- Use that theme for your personal statement.
- Refine ruthlessly to meet word limits and funder expectations.

Your research deserves to be understood and funded. A well-crafted narrative CV helps you tell that story more effectively.

The narrative CV format is still relatively new, and many researchers find it challenging. If you'd like hands-on support with developing and refining your narratives, ask your institution to book [one of my narrative CV workshops](../../../workshops/writing-a-narrative-cv/) where we'll work through the process together and you'll receive feedback on your drafts. We also discuss how to contribute to team narrative CVs.
