Throughout my career, I’ve identified technical and accessibility barriers that limit research progress. In response, I developed practical solutions combining instrument development, computational methods, and open science practices. I advance fundamental understanding of protein behaviour while ensuring methods are accessible to laboratories with limited resources. These interconnected approaches — technical innovation, collaborative validation, and knowledge sharing — position me to lead [proposed project], which requires both methodological expertise and commitment to democratising advanced techniques.",-1)])]),_:1},16))}},w=u(h,[["__scopeId","data-v-5ca8df33"]]);export{w as default};
