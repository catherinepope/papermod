Some studies appear to suggest that mechanical loading could possibly stimulate bone formation, but it’s difficult to say for certain whether these effects are clinically meaningful. There may be some indication that women who engage in regular resistance training tend to experience less bone density loss compared to those who don’t, though more research is probably needed to confirm this. It could be argued that these findings might support the idea that resistance training should possibly be considered as one potential intervention among several options for managing bone health during menopause, though practitioners should perhaps exercise caution in making strong recommendations at this stage.",-1)])]),_:1})]),_:1},16)}}};export{C as default};
