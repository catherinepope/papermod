Many women experience reduced quality of life and are looking for ways to manage symptoms without medication. Resistance training or weightlifting has become popular and some research suggests it might help with various menopausal symptoms and health issues. This review looks at what we know about resistance training for menopausal women and whether it actually works. We examined studies on bone health, body composition, metabolism, heart health, and mental health outcomes. The evidence shows that lifting weights can help preserve bone density and maintain muscle mass as women age. It also seems to improve metabolic markers and may help with mood and sleep problems that many menopausal women experience. However, there are still questions about how much training is needed and what types of exercises work best. Many women don’t do resistance training even though it might help them, possibly because they don’t know about the benefits or feel intimidated by gyms. More work is needed to figure out how to get more menopausal women doing resistance training and to understand the long-term effects.",-1)])]),_:1})]),_:1},16)}}};export{T as default};
